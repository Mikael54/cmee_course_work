FEEDBACK SUMMARY
======================================================================

Scripts tested: 9
Scripts successful: 7
Scripts with errors: 2
Warnings/Notes: 1

IMPORTANT DEBUGGING GUIDANCE:
------------------------------

Please review all warnings and errors, and your directory structure based on the above log.

Ask yourself: Why did I not get these warnings or errors on my machine when I tested my code?
Common reasons for environment differences:

• File paths: Your local machine may have different directory structures
• Dependencies: Missing packages or different versions
• File permissions: Scripts may not be executable on the testing server
• Case sensitivity: Linux systems are case-sensitive (your laptop may not be)
• Working directory: Scripts may assume they run from a specific location
• Input files: Required data files may be missing or in wrong locations

Debugging steps:
1. Test your code in a clean environment (fresh directory)
2. Check all file paths are relative and correct
3. Verify all required files are present and properly named
4. Test on a case-sensitive system if possible
5. Run your scripts from different directories to check robustness

Fix these issues and test again. Good debugging skills are essential for scientific computing!
