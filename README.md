### Directory Purposes

- **`code/`** - Contains all executable scripts and programs developed during the week
- **`data/`** - Stores input data files required for analyses and exercises
- **`results/`** - Holds output files generated by scripts (`.gitignore` prevents these from being committed)
- **`README.md`** - Comprehensive documentation with script descriptions, usage examples, and dependencies

---

## Dependencies

**Note:** Exact package dependencies and installation instructions are specified in each week's individual README file. Please refer to the appropriate weekly README for detailed requirements.

### General System Requirements
- **Operating System:** Unix/Linux environment or macOS
- **Shell:** Bash 4.0 or higher
- **Python:** Version 3.8 or higher
- **R:** Version 4.0 or higher

---

### Generating Results


1. Navigate to the appropriate week's `code/` directory
2. Run the scripts following the usage instructions in that week's README
3. Output files will be created in the corresponding `results/` directory
