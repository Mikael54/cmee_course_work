### Directory Purposes

- **`code/`** - Contains all executable scripts and programs developed during the week
- **`data/`** - Stores input data files required for analyses and exercises
- **`results/`** - Holds output files generated by scripts (`.gitignore` prevents these from being committed)
- **`README.md`** - Comprehensive documentation with script descriptions, usage examples, and dependencies
